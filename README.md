# Yihang_Chen_mini_data_analysis

### Welcome everyone. My name is Yihang Chen. I am a graduate student in the Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of British Columbia. 

This is my repo for the mini data anlysis assignments for STAT545A course at winter 2021 term. There are in total three parts: milestone1, milestone2 and milestone3.

The packages we are using are _datateachr_ and _tidyverse_.

**Milestone 1** is mainly about choosing a proper dataset from given dataset and start the analysis. The dataset that I chose finally is "steam game". The main objectives we are working on milestone 1 are 
1) Write a brief description for each of the four datasets after exploring them, and pick one to work on. 
2) Use _dplyr_ and _ggplot_ and complete 4 out of provided 8 exerices on the chosen dataset. 
3) For each of chosen 4 exercises, provide a brief explanation. 
4) Come up with four research questions for this dataset.

**Milestone 2** is aiming to become familar with manipulating and summarizing the data in tibbles using _dplyer_ and _tidyr_, to answer the research questions.  Furthermore, understand what *tidy* data is. The main tasks we are working on milestone 2 are: 
1) Identify the 4 research questions that came up with in milestone1.
2) For reach of the research questions, choose one task from summarizing and one from graphing. Comment on why each task helps or doesnt help to answer the corresponding research question. 
3) Evaluate the research questions again based on previous analysis. 
4) Evaluate if the dataset is tidy or non-tidey and explain. 
5) Tidy or untidy the dataset depends on the previous evaluation. 
6) Pick 2 of the 4 questions for milestone 3.
